				<p class="author">By Robert Bradford</p>
				<p><img src="http://www.cssp.com/strategyletter/pics/robert-bradford-presenting.jpg" alt="Robert Bradford" class="photo-right" />The other day, a client was chatting with me and mentioned something about my strategic planning work I'd never thought of: I ask weird questions. Not so weird, in my mind - but my favorite questions are always strategic, and always lead to excellent discussions about the sources of value in business and how you can create more.</p>

				<p class="archive-author">By Denise Harrison</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">How can we better deal with uncertainty when we develop our strategic plan? Many strategic planning teams struggle with this issue. While it is important to understand what you know as facts and what your assumptions for the future are, I have found that some good scenario planning helps a team prepare for a wider range of possibilities that might occur in the future.</p>

				<p class="archive-author">By M. Dana Baldwin</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">When your team gets so busy they can't put in the time to continue their responsibilities to execute their parts of your strategic plan, what do you do? No surprise, it is up to you to change the atmosphere in which they are working to get them back on task. What needs to happen?</p>

				<p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/strategicplanning/blog/simplifying-your-business/" target="_blank">Simplify Your Business</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By Robert W. Bradford</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">Last week, I was talking with someone about their insurance agent. She was absolutely thrilled at how the agent handled a recent car accident, saying "She made everything so much simpler!" It got me thinking about simplicity, and how it works in companies we like - and those we don't like. What hit me was that the way your company handles simplification will put you clearly into one camp or the other, and it has a lot to do with the attitude you have about your business, your employees, and your customers</p>

                <p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/strategicplanning/blog/listening-an-important-skill-for-successful-strategic-planning/" target="_blank">Listening: An Important Skill for Successful Strategic Planning</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By Denise Harrison</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">Recently I spoke with a CEO and found that the most important thing that his team learned during strategic planning was the importance of listening. This was an unusual answer to my question asking how his team had benefitted from the strategic planning process, so I asked him to explain his answer. He said that his company was full of "idea" people who spent so much time talking about their ideas that they failed to listen to others. Without solving this problem, his company would have been stuck in the mud and perhaps gone out of business because nothing moved forward - each person was his or her own island.</p>

                <p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/strategicplanning/blog/strategic-planning-only-for-corporate/" target="_blank">Strategic Planning - Only For Corporate?</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By M. Dana Baldwin</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">Most people know that in order to help an organization focus on its future and to build plans/strategies to improve market share, profitability and competitive stature, that a company should go through a formal, well-organized planning process which will result in specific objectives and actionable strategies.</p>

				<p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/CD0215b/WhyMostStrategicPlansDontProduceResutls/" target="_blank">Why Most Strategic Plans Don't Produce Results</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By Robert W. Bradford</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">Over the past couple of weeks, I've had some interesting conversations with a client about what we do in strategic planning. You see, there are lots of approaches to strategic planning - some of which work - but we do something just a bit differently than most.</p>

				<p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/CD0215a/StrategicPlanningFactVsOpinion/" target="_blank">Strategic Planning: Are Your Decisions Based on Fact or Opinions?</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By Denise Harrison</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">Many people return from a strategic planning retreat frustrated, often asking: Were we really concentrating on what is important or were we focusing on what was "top of mind"?  Did we make the right decisions or were we swayed by the most persuasive person?</p>

				<p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/CD0115a/HowEngagedAreYouAsALeader/" target="_blank">How Engaged are You as a Leader?</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By M Dana Baldwin</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">Many people, including yours truly, have written extensively on the value of increasing employee engagement.  There are many good reasons to do so. Included are: Better attitudes, better involvement in the success of the company or organization, higher productivity, better quality, lower scrap or rejects, better profitability, higher levels of internal entrepreneurship, more suggestions for improvement and overall better relationships within the company.</p>

				<p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/CD1214/DoesFocusOnWeaknessesHelp/" target="_blank">Does Focus on Weaknesses Help?</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By Robert W. Bradford</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">One of the most vexing issues encountered in strategic planning is a focus on the negative, especially threats and weaknesses. Obviously, we'd all like to avoid having weaknesses, but let's face the truth: no matter how hard you try, or how much you pretend, every organization has weaknesses. Greatness never comes as the result of eliminating weaknesses for one simple reason:  it's impossible. Beyond that simple fact, making corrective action beyond a certain point an inevitable waste of time, attempting to correct weaknesses can do more harm than good.</p>

				<p class="archive"><a href="http://www.cssp.com/CD1114a/GamePlayingImportantToSony/" target="_blank">Game Playing Will Be Important to Sony's Future Success</a></p>
				<p class="archive-author">By Denise Harrison</p>
				<p class="archive-desc">Sony exemplifies how a company must continually refocus its resources in order to optimize its future potential. An earlier article discussed how Sony was exiting and de-emphasizing some of its core business to focus on areas with higher potential.  As the strategy is evolving, we see that Sony is continuing to re-focus its resources to regain growth and profitability by broadening its gaming division to focus on entertainment.</p>
